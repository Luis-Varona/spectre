# SPECTRE

## Overview
```SPECTRE``` is a program under development for the automated recording, analysis, and visualisation of radio spectrograms. It consists of three primary components: 
- ```spectre-host``` - a containerised environment for recording radio spectrograms, delivered with an accompanying CLI tool.
- ```spectre-client``` - a web-based application for viewing and analysis.
- ```spectre``` - a standalone Python package for recording, analysing and visualising radio spectrograms.

This program is building on the existing [```grso```](https://github.com/jcfitzpatrick12/grso) repository.

# spectre-host

## Introduction
```spectre-host``` is the principal back-end component of the SPECTRE program. It offers a containerised environment for the automated recording of radio spectrograms. Underpinned with gnuradio, it aims to accommodate any SDR receiver with a gnuradio source block. Initial support is focused on the RSP* series via [```gr-sdrplay3```](https://github.com/fventuri/gr-sdrplay3). The tool is delivered with an accompanying CLI tool.

## Supported Operating Systems
This project is tested to be compatible with the following operating systems:

- Ubuntu 22.04.3

It may also work on other Linux distributions and other Ubuntu versions. Support for Windows is planned for the future.
