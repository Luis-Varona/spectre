# SPECTRE

## Overview
```SPECTRE``` is a program under development for the automated recording, analysis, and visualization of radio spectrograms. It consists of three primary components: ```spectre-host```, a CLI tool (with an accompanying ready-made, containerized environment) for recording radio spectrograms, ```spectre-client```, a web-based application for viewing and analysis and ```spectre``` a standalone package for recording, analysing and visualising radio spectrograms. This program builds upon the existing [```grso```](https://github.com/jcfitzpatrick12/grso) repository.

# spectre-host (in development)

## Introduction
```spectre-host```, the principal back-end component of the SPECTRE program, is a CLI tool for the automated recording of radio spectrograms. Underpinned with gnuradio, it aims to accommodate any SDR receiver with a gnuradio source block. Initial support is focused on the RSP* series via [```gr-sdrplay3```](https://github.com/fventuri/gr-sdrplay3). The tool is delivered with a ready-made, containerized environment.

## Supported Operating Systems
